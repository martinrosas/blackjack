# Blackjack


Premise of the Game
The basic premise of the game is that you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than that of the dealer, without going over 21. If you go over 21 you "bust" and you lose.Your hand competes only against the hand of the dealer. 


Values of the Cards
In blackjack, the cards are valued as follows:
An Ace counts as 11 at all times. 
The cards from 2 through 9 are valued at their face value.
The 10, Jack, Queen, and King are all valued at 10.


Dealing the Cards
The dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to himself. One of the dealer
cards is dealt face up. The facedown card is called the "hole card."
He must draw cards until he has a total of 17 or more. The dealer has no choice in how to play the hand. He must continue taking cards until his total is at least 17. 

Player Choices : Hitting and Standing

A player has 2 choices to make during this game, whether to draw another card to the hand (“hit”), or stop at the current total (“stand”).

Wins, Losses, and Ties
If you have a higher hand than the dealer and you did not "bust" you win.
If you "bust" or the dealer has a higher hand than you, you lose.
If your hand is equal to the dealer the game is a tie.

Unsolved problems and/or planned features (Next Steps) 
Need to disable hit button after player reaches 21. 
Would like to add betting, doubling down, splitting and the option to make aces 1 or 11.
